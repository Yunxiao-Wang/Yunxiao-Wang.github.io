abstract: Video moment localization, also known as video moment retrieval, aims to search a target segment within a video described by a given natural language query. Beyond the task of temporal action localization whereby the target actions are pre-defined, video moment retrieval can query arbitrary complex activities. In this survey paper, we aim to present a comprehensive review of existing video moment localization techniques, including supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised ones. We also review the datasets available for video moment localization and group results of related work. In addition, we discuss promising future directions for this field, in particular large-scale datasets and interpretable video moment localization models.
